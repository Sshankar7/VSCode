Certainly! You can use the MSXML2.ServerXMLHTTP60 library to connect to the XMLA server and execute an MDX query. Below is an optimized VBA code that fetches data using CellSet and pastes it into an Excel sheet.

To make the code run efficiently, we ensure that we minimize interactions with Excel objects inside loops.

Firstly, ensure you have enabled the reference to "Microsoft XML, v6.0" in your VBA editor (Tools > References).

Here is the optimized VBA code:

```vba
Option Explicit

Sub FetchMDXData()
    Dim xmlaServer As String
    Dim mdxQuery As String
    Dim httpRequest As MSXML2.ServerXMLHTTP60
    Dim responseXML As MSXML2.DOMDocument60
    Dim cellset As Object
    Dim data As Variant
    Dim i As Long, j As Long
    Dim rowIndex As Long
    Dim ws As Worksheet
    
    ' Define the XMLA server URL and the MDX query
    xmlaServer = "YOUR_XMLA_SERVER_URL"
    mdxQuery = "YOUR_MDX_QUERY_HERE"

    ' Create the XML HTTP request
    Set httpRequest = New MSXML2.ServerXMLHTTP60

    ' Craft the XMLA request body
    Dim soapBody As String
    soapBody = "<Envelope xmlns='http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/envelope/'>" & _
               "<Body>" & _
               "<Execute xmlns='urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xml-analysis'>" & _
               "<Command>" & _
               "<Statement>" & mdxQuery & "</Statement>" & _
               "</Command>" & _
               "<Properties>" & _
               "<PropertyList>" & _
               "<DataSourceInfo>Provider=MSOLAP;Data Source=" & xmlaServer & "</DataSourceInfo>" & _
               "<Catalog>YOUR_CATALOG_HERE</Catalog>" & _
               "<Format>Multidimensional</Format>" & _
               "<AxisFormat>TupleFormat</AxisFormat>" & _
               "</PropertyList>" & _
               "</Properties>" & _
               "</Execute>" & _
               "</Body>" & _
               "</Envelope>"

    ' Send the request
    With httpRequest
        .Open "POST", xmlaServer, False
        .setRequestHeader "Content-Type", "text/xml"
        .send soapBody
    End With

    ' Load the response into a DOMDocument
    Set responseXML = New MSXML2.DOMDocument60
    responseXML.LoadXML httpRequest.responseText

    ' Set up the worksheet
    Set ws = ThisWorkbook.Sheets("Sheet1")
    ws.Cells.ClearContents
    rowIndex = 1

    ' Load the CellSet from the response
    Set cellset = CreateObject("ADOMD.CellSet")
    cellset.Open responseXML.XML

    ' Redimension array to fetch results first, optimizing the loop
    ReDim data(1 To cellset.Axes(1).Positions.Count, 1 To cellset.Axes(0).Positions.Count)
    
    ' Fetch MDX data into the array
    For i = 0 To cellset.Axes(1).Positions.Count - 1
        For j = 0 To cellset.Axes(0).Positions.Count - 1
            data(i + 1, j + 1) = cellset(i, j).Value
        Next j
    Next i
    
    ' Place array into Excel sheet in a single step, minimizing Excel interaction
    ws.Range(ws.Cells(1, 1), ws.Cells(UBound(data, 1), UBound(data, 2))).Value = data

    ' Close the CellSet
    cellset.Close

    ' Clear the objects
    Set cellset = Nothing
    Set responseXML = Nothing
    Set httpRequest = Nothing
    
    MsgBox "Data fetched successfully!", vbInformation
End Sub
```

**Explanation:**

1. **References:**
   - Ensure the `Microsoft XML, v6.0` reference is enabled.
   
2. **SOAP Request:**
   - Constructs the SOAP envelope with necessary elements for the XMLA server query.
   
3. **HTTP Request:**
   - Uses `MSXML2.ServerXMLHTTP60` to POST the request and fetch the response.
   
4. **Data Handling:**
   - `MSXML2.DOMDocument60` loads the response.
   - The `ADOMD.CellSet` object performs parsing and iteration over the result set.
   
5. **Optimization:**
   - Fetches results in an array, then sets that array to the worksheet in one call, minimizing the use of the `Excel` object model inside loops.

Replace `"YOUR_XMLA_SERVER_URL"`, `"YOUR_MDX_QUERY_HERE"`, and `"YOUR_CATALOG_HERE"` with the actual values for your XMLA server, MDX query, and catalog respectively.

This approach ensures that the code runs as efficiently as possible with minimal time spent in the loop.
